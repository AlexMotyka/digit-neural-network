# digit-neural-network

To run the neural network 'cd' into the project directory and run 'python neural-net.py'

neural-net.py is the script that trains and tests the neural network. It leverages data from digits.py and testDigits.py

number_gen.py is a helper script that generates variations of each digit using mutations(flipping a pixel value). These generated digits are used for training the network
